# Ad-Campaign-Analysis
In 2024, a reputable marketing agency launched two major digital advertising campaigns: Facebook Ads and Google Ads to promote the same product line.  The goal was to evaluate which platform delivers better performance, higher conversions, and greater cost efficiency.

**Business Problem**

As a marketing agency, our goal is to help clients achieve maximum returns from their ad spend. In 2024, we launched two major advertising campaigns: Facebook and Google, both designed to drive traffic, conversions, and revenue for the same product line.

We need to determine which platform yields better results in terms of clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness.

**Why The Need To Act**

Without clear visibility into which platform performs best, our marketing spend risks inefficiency and potential waste.

· Budget Misallocation: Continuing to invest evenly across both channels may not be the most effective use of resources.

· Missed Growth Opportunities: The lack of insight into platform performance prevents us from scaling the more successful campaign.

· Poor Decision-Making: Without data-driven insights, campaign optimization becomes based on assumptions rather than measurable performance trends.

By acting now, the agency can make evidence-based budget allocation decisions, improve client satisfaction, and strengthen overall campaign ROI.

**Business Objectives**

Compare performance metrics between Facebook and Google campaigns to identify which platform generates better engagement, conversions, and ROI
Uncover performance patterns across days, weeks, and months to understand when and where each platform performs best.
Determine cost-effectiveness by analyzing metrics such as CPC and total spend across both campaigns.
Provide actionable recommendations for optimizing future ad budgets, targeting strategies, and platform selection.
